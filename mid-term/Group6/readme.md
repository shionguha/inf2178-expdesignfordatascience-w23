This repository consists of mid term project submissions from students. 

---

**Instructions**

- Create a directory with your name in this directory, within which you upload your code script (named as group1-code.ipynb) and report (named as group1-writeup.pdf).
- There should be a single code file, i.e, *do not* form multiple notebooks for different hypothesis. 
- If you are using colab as the coding platform, then make sure to include the link of your notebook in your github submission file. 
- The url (e.g.,https://github.com/shionguha/inf2178-expdesignfordatascience-w23/pull/119) to your pull request (PR) should be submitted in quercus. The PR should be named as group1-PR. Kindly delete your previously created test PRs to avoid any confusion. Only ONE PR per group should be submitted.
- No zip files will be graded. 
- You would be deducted points if a proper pull request (PR) is not submitted. A correct PR would include your files as commits (not as comments)!
