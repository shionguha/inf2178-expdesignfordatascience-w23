These are the main statistical components required for the final project submission: 

power analysis (compute power graph of the particular equation and discuss about the relevant components, such as effect size, sample size )
ANCOVA
logistic regression (interpretation of results, example odds ratio)
For the final project, you are required to build on top of your mid-term submission. That means that you will continue to work with the same dataset as used for mid-term. You are free to update your mid-term analysis as appropriate and if required. 

Writeup sections--

Introduction (includes background, lit review)
EDA (it can be the same as mid-term, but you are expected to add to it to support your new analysis)
Methods ( overview of analysis approach you are taking. the actual findings are to be reported in results section)
Results/ Findings 
Discussion
Conclusion
Notes

Please do not paste code outputs from python. to report test results, customize your own table, instead of copying code output. 
You all are encouraged to divide the work into smaller weekly deadline internally within your group so as to prevent last minute stress and conflicts. 
A plot for prediction interval for your logistic regression is required. Plotting confidence interval is optional, but will be positively graded if it is created. 
No post-hoc test is required for ANCOVA.
If you are using new predictors in your models, you should have some new relevant EDA / t-test/ ANCOVAs for those variables. Otherwise, you don't need to separately conduct new tests/ EDA for the older variables you used earlier.  
For the power curve analysis
you need to analyze the sample sizes from your power analysis. (E.g.,  does your model have appropriate number of sample size?) (Please note that the samples sizes will be different based on the number of groups in your predictor variable)
it is included in methods section as it is conducted a-priori (remember t-tests go in EDA)
You can free to (re)use content from mid-term report if it adds to your final report's story. 
There is no page limit, but please restrict to under 50 pages.
Chi-squared test in not required, but you may use it if you need to show / prove something.
You are free to copy codes from the tutorials and class notes.
All the best! Please post your questions on the Quercus discussion board. https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/298096/discussion_topics/2137971
